What is Emmet?
Emmet is a set of plugins for fast coding and editing in HTML via content assist


Library vs Framework ?
Library : Reuse , code controlled calls, 
Framework : new s/w dev , framework controls function calls

CDN : Content delivery networks , helps in caching of content near to end users

React - Creating elements
ReactDOM - DOM related operations

react.development.js are not optimized and used for development purpose only, for applications working in prod , we need to used react.production.js

async - No sequential execution
defer - execute js file after html file has been loaded

crossorigin allows error logging for websites using different servers for static media
